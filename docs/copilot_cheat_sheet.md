# Copilot Agents Cheat Sheet - AI Operations Workshop

## Overview

This cheat sheet provides a quick reference for workshop proctors on the different Copilot agents and their key commands/tasks used throughout the AI Operations Workshop.

---

## General Command Failures

- [] Ensure the user is in PowerShell 7 in the Windows Terminal
- [] Ensure the user is in the correct folder ($env:USERPROFILE/aks-store-demo)

## AZD Deployment Failure

The `azd` deployment can potentially fail if the availability zones in the region where the resources are being deployed change availability.

You will see an error like:

```text
ERROR: error executing step command 'provision': deployment failed: error deploying infrastructure: validating deployment to resource group:

Validation Error Details:
POST https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/<SUBSCRIPTION_ID>/resourcegroups/<RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME>/providers/Microsoft.Resources/deployments/aitour-1761061937/validate

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
RESPONSE 400: 400 Bad Request
ERROR CODE: InvalidTemplateDeployment
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

{
  "error": {
    "code": "InvalidTemplateDeployment",
    "message": "The template deployment 'aitour-1761061937' is not valid according to the validation procedure. The tracking id is '421aa3c7-aae7-4257-8a36-a6db46f5fd0d'. See inner errors for details.",
    "details": [
      {
        "code": "AvailabilityZoneNotSupported",
        "message": "Preflight validation check for resource(s) for container service aks-aitourrkdg in resource group <RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME> failed. Message: The zone(s) '1' for resource 'system' is not supported. The supported zones for location 'eastus2' are '3,2'. Details: "
      }
    ]
  }
}
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

There are currently overrides for the few restrictions that have been found during the course development, but if a user has a problem, they can add an override using the availability zones mentioned in the error response.

```powershell
$Overrides = @{
  "eastus2" = @{"zones" = ("2", "3")}
  "westus2" = @{"zones" = @("3")}
  "eastus" = @{"zones" = ("2", "1")}
  # Replace REGION with the problem region in the sample below, adjusting to the the valid zones mentioned in the error message.
  # then, uncomment and paste this section into the terminal
  # "REGION" = @{"zones" = ("3", "2", "1")}
}
```

Then, replace REGION with your region in the snippet below and run the below commands.

```powershell
$zones = $Overrides['REGION'].zones -join ', '
azd env set AKS_AVAILABILITY_ZONES $zones

# retry the deployment
azd up
```

# Lab Exercise Notes

**Follow-up:**

```text
List all public-facing services in my aks cluster in the pets namespace and their external ip address and exposed ports.
```

**Expected:** Specific kubectl commands for LoadBalancer services

#### Monitoring & Troubleshooting:

How would I make this AKS cluster more resilient?
```

**Expected:** Recommendations for backup, zones, maintenance, premium tiers

```text
How can I check if my AKS nodes are using availability zones?

**Follow-up:**

```text
How would I do that in Terraform?
```

**Expected:** Terraform configuration examples

---

### Context: Infrastructure as Code Generation

Also configure a default node pool and enable network plugin 'azure'.
```

---

## Common Troubleshooting Tips for Proctors

1. **If Copilot returns a failure:** Start a new chat - previous context can cause issues
2. **For specific queries:** Change context (e.g., go to AKS resource for AKS-specific queries)
3. **Portal execution:** Look for "Yes" buttons to execute suggested commands in Azure Portal
4. **YAML editor:** Available in Kubernetes resources with Copilot assistance
5. **MCP servers:** Require proper permissions and trust settings
6. **Variable substitution:** Use actual URLs/names instead of placeholders in prompts
